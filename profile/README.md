# Hol0
Hol0 (formerly Graphene) is an extensible microblogging platform implemented in Python (with some libraries implemented in Rust and others).

# FAQ
## Why the name "Hol0"?
The name of a character in a certain Japanese novel is partially replaced by Leet. Another reason is that I couldn't think of a name other than this and Graphene.

## Why wasn't it implemented from existing software?
This is because I am so bad at understanding code written by others. Also, writing code in TypeScript (JavaScript) is likely to be of lower quality than developing in Python.

## How to create a custom frontend
We will clarify this in the documentation soon. It is unlikely that we will have a Vue3 or other template in the future (unless we rewrite Hol0FE in Vue3).

## What is your (AmaseCocoa) favorite food?
I like Sushiüç£ :)

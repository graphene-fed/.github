# FAQ
## Why the name "Holo"?
The name of a character in a certain Japanese novel is partially replaced by Leet. Another reason is that I couldn't think of a name other than this and Graphene.

## Why wasn't it implemented from existing software?
This is because I am so bad at understanding code written by others. Also, writing code in TypeScript (JavaScript) is likely to be of lower quality than developing in Python.

## How to create a custom frontend
We will clarify this in the documentation soon. It is unlikely that we will have a Vue3 or other template in the future (unless we rewrite Hol0FE in Vue3).

## Is it different from [Hollo](https://github.com/dahlia/hollo)/what is the difference?
[Hollo](https://github.com/dahlia/hollo) is a [Fedify](https://github.com/dahlia/fedify)-powered microblogging software that implements the Mastodon API. It is intended for single user and has no front end. (Mastodon client is available).

Holo is an extensible microblogging software written using Python/FastAPI and designed for large server operations to single user operations. It also implements its own API and the Misskey API. The front end is compatible and uses the standard HoloFE.

The name Hollo may change as it is too confusing and similar to Hollo :3

## What is your (AmaseCocoa) favorite food?
